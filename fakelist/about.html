    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>There is not much to say really!
        I created this as a final project for LAMPP class
        at UCSC Extension for Fall 2018. So far, I have enjoyed the class
        as I have learned new things.
    </p>
    <p> I hope to learn more about web app development
        during my free time maybe
    </p>
